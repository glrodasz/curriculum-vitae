            I have always love to connect with the tech community, and since
            very early in my career I learn by teaching giving talks in
            different local communities. It has been more than 30 talks in
            meetups, podcasts, and events.

            Because I really love the idea of give to the community I also
            become organizer of CSS Community Dev an umbrella organization for
            different CSS communities around the world (Medell√≠n, Bogot√°, and
            Stockholm), and later I become organizer of CSS Conf Colombia an

            I enjoy mentoring, and in 2019 I had the opportunity of joining the
            Google Developer Experts group for the category of Web Technologies.
            Later in 2020 I started as a Twitch Streamer in the Software and
            Game Development category, where I show to other developers how I
            usually solve problems. I have also recorded 4 courses with Platzi
            the biggest online education platform in Latin America.
